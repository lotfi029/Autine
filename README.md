**Autine** is an intelligent system designed to support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through an interactive, AI-driven environment.  
It allows users to communicate with a **trained chatbot** that helps them develop communication skills safely and effectively — all under the **supervision of specialized doctors** who can customize the chatbot’s settings according to each patient’s needs.

## 🎯 Project Goal  

The goal of **Autine** is to build a **virtualization system** that helps autistic patients prepare for real-world communication by interacting with an intelligent chatbot that simulates realistic conversations.  
Doctors and therapists can:  
- Adjust chatbot settings and dialogue scenarios based on the patient’s condition.  
- Monitor real-time chat sessions.  
- Analyze communication data to track improvement over time.

## ⚡ Performance Optimization  

To ensure scalability and fast response times, the system includes several optimization strategies:  
- **Optimized Queries:** Rewritten SQL queries for maximum efficiency.  
- **CQRS Implementation:** Separation of read/write operations to improve database performance.  
- **Caching:** Reused frequently accessed data to reduce database hits.  
- **SignalR Optimization:** Tuned WebSocket connections for low-latency real-time communication.  
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilized async/await to handle high concurrency smoothly.  
- **SOLID and Clean Code:** Ensured maintainable, efficient code that minimizes runtime overhead.
